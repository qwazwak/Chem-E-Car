Find the rules [here at AIChE's website](https://www.aiche.org/students/chem-e-car-competition/chem-e-car-competition-rules#panels-pane-entity-field-nodefield-global-public-files). Scroll down and find the Competition Official Rules document.

This is the code for the TTU ChemECar team's microcontroller.
It is aimed at being highly adaptable and maintainable, usable with lots of hardware and for years to come.

# Commenting and Documentation
- Comment all the code, lots!
    - Heres the thing, whether it's you or somebody else, they won't know what you were thinking
    - So put lots of indepth comments everywhere
-  All functions should have an explaination at its declaration/definition

```
 /*
 * <function name> 
 * 
 * Purpose: - <What it does>
 *
 * Pre-conditions - <Anything somebody using this function should know that the function assumes?>
 *
 * Post-conditions - <Anything somebody using this function should know that the function assumes?>
 *
 * Parameters - <What the parameters are, explain>
 *
 * Returns - <What value is returned and if anything else is done, explain>
* 
*/
```
